# basicVision
Modules for common tools used in machine vision
Libraries will be created as openCV replacement for common tools found in industrial frameworks such as Cognex, Keyence, Banner, Sick, Stemmer, Microscan
Basic Graphic tools (magic wand, pippette, search/pattern regions with mouse, etc) will also be created here
Initial libraries will be done in Python, but eventually plan to use Julia, C++, and other languages
